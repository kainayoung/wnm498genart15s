**Created by**: Kenichi Yoneda (Kynd) in collaboration with Tokyo ‘visual label’ BRDG

**Music by**: Yaporigami/Yu Miyashita

Trained as a fine artist, today Kenichi Yoneda (Kynd) is a designer for an electronics company.
An audio-visual experiment displayed on vimeo.

### UX Flow
1. User clicks the play button.

### Analysis
The visuals generated by this experiment have an organic and mechanical feel. The effects of watercolor are successful because it gradually bleeds off how real watercolor would when brushed or dropped on paper. The explosions of flowers support the audio in a meaningful way. I think the contrast of organic fluidity and mechanical movements work really well in harmony here.

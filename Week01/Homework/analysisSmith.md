*The Augmented Hand Series* was created by **Golan Levin**, **Chris Sugrue**, and **Kyle McDonald** for the 
**Cinekid Festival** for children’s media. This project was developed using openFrameworks.
The full scope of the project can be found [here](http://www.creativeapplications.net/openframeworks/the-augmented-hand-series/) 
This installation piece works with 
+Video 	+Live Rendering  	+Human Interaction to provide an enchanting and
mind-blowing experience. 

>"The project explores interrelations of hand, mind and identity and is designed as ‘an instrument for probing or muddling embodied cognition‘ using a ‘direct manipulation’ interface and the suspension of disbelief to further problematize the mind-body problem‘.'' Cited from [creativeapplications.net](http://www.creativeapplications.net/)


First the user steps up to the art piece and places their hand into a box which has a camera hidden inside. 
Then a large projection screen displays the augmenation and alternative view of their hand. The system works 
when the hand is wriggled. It is so robust that jewelry, tattoos, nailpolish and the like does 
not affect the systems and displays them normally. 

>"To build a model of the visitor’s hand, 
the project combines geometric information about the hand’s “skeleton” (obtained from a Leap Motion controller), 
with pixel- and contour-based information gleaned from a high resolution color video camera 
(with the aid of OpenCV-based image processing techniques such as background subtraction, blob detection, 
edge detection, and contour extraction). 
Because the camera and the Leap controller are necessarily located in physically different places, they observe the visitor’s hand from different points of view. " Cited from [creativeapplications.net](http://www.creativeapplications.net/)

The user can change views using a touch-screen swipe motion to watch their hand go through a variety of transformations. The user can see what their hand would look like with three fingers or what it would look like if their fingers had springs. 


This project is very sucessful in terms of inticing and keeping the wonderment of children's imagination alive.

In order to render a model of the users hand The Leap Motion analyzes the skeleton of the hand and the camera is providing the contouring to send to
to the custom written code and software. The high-res video camera provides the pixel and contour based information, with
some help from Open-CV image processing to erase the background an detect edges.
The way that the designers are using the leap motion technology and video camera
to render the art piece on the projection screens is innovative, user-friendly, enchanting and beautiful. 

##Concert Visuals for The Superbowl Halftime Show

========================================
*The Superbowl XLIX halftime show* featuring **Katy Perry** and very special guests **Lenny Kravitz** and the forever flawless **Missy Elliot** was breathtaking to say the least. One of the most interesting things about the halftime show was the stunning image mapping that was creating the awe-inspiring concert visuals. The studio that was responsible for this large scale project is [lightbourne studio](http://lightborne.com/). 


Some of the specific people involved were the *Super Bowl's* halftime show director **Hamish Hamilton**, producer **Ricky Kirshner**, production designer **Bruce Rodgers**, lighting designer **Bob Barnhart**, and server operator **Jason Rudolph** and video content director **Ben Nicholson**. This
studio has a background in designing concert visuals for the likes of **Deadmau5**, **Kanye West* and *katy Perry* in the past. 

>"...the event didn't seem out of reach: "Doing the Super Bowl was a simple extension of the team Katy has put together over the years that she trusts," video content director Ben Nicholson tells The Creators Project. "She is very involved, very savvy and watches every frame of everything." cited from

*Pre-visualization for the complicated chessboard segment*

The production value for the halftime show obviously had to be on point and perfect. There were three main segments that relied on projection-mapping: **a perspective-bending chess board**, **a tropical beach party* 
and the beautiful mind-blowing finale that included image-mapped fireworks and real fireworks, complete with 
**Katy Perry** riding through the air on a shooting star.

>"With perspective mapping, if you are off in your rendered camera view the gag wont work," Nicholson explains. "The surface was huge and there is so little time to rehearse in the actual environment. Preparation and previsualization really made everything work."

The artists pulled off this large-scale image-mapping extravaganza using a piece of software called the 
[D3 Media Server](http://www.d3technologies.com/). This powerful software allows brilliant artists to map out their projections visually. The user flow for this project is simple, the user is the viewer and as the performance goes on the eye gets to view stunning and mezmorizing image mapping projections. 

>"In D3 we plotted the hero camera position for the perspective mapping a month ahead of time, based on a CAD model of the stadium, NBC’s camera plot, and Bruce Rogers' detailed location scout photos," Nicholson says, reiterating the fact that preparation was everything. "It was lots of super-pro people communicating well, and a great piece of software."

This was one of the nicest superbowl half-time shows I've ever seen. Although Katy Perry herself is a little lacking as a performer and perhaps she could have lip synched a little better. That all said the concert visuals had my attention from the beggining.

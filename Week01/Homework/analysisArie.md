Created by Jeremy Rotsztain for Safari, an online exhibition for SPAMM, Swipin’ Safari is an app for iOS and the vehicle for taking a virtual safari across an infinite painting. With each gesture, you encounter new species of brush strokes and colorful patterns which endlessly redraw, generate, connect and change colour.

The app was created using openFrameworks and optimizes its drawing routine by determining which shapes are on screen — and only draws those shapes. The active area (what you see on screen when you run Swipin’ Safari) is directly in the center, displayed as a red rectangle. Active shapes are drawn in full-color, while non-active shapes are drawn as outlines with points. The bars at the bottom show the distribution and placement of shapes in relation to the camera area. Make sure you check out the superb hidden easter egg – “debug view” – by holding your finger on the top right corner of the screen for around 5 seconds.

_UX Flows:_
1. Open the app and the screen will go into horizontal mode on your iphone.
2. Swipe left and see the irregular shapes floating to left.
3. The shapes will grow or change colors as user swipe.
4. The direction of the flow will give user an illusion of rotating the canvas.

_Analysis:_
The interaction is simple and intuitive and it's also a joy to watch how the canvas rotates and the shapes changes in the movement.
Although I would like to see there's more interactive function in this game, not just swipe. But the movement is smooth, the design is clean and easy to look at on iphone screen. It's a good iphone app reference for creating games.

ARTWORK 2
##Lilypad

Process : [http://www.uncontrol.com/posts/lily-pad-experiment/](http://www.uncontrol.com/posts/lily-pad-experiment/)
Technology: WebGL, Three.js, DAT.GUI, jQuery and jsTween

Lily pad is an experiment that explores paper folding inspired by the form of a lily pad floating on top of water.

_UX Flows:_
1. Open the browser and see the visualization on the left and a pannel on the right.
2. Drag the visual and it can rotate and change the angle of the view.
3. In the pannel and change the parameters, the pattern will change dynamically.

_Analysis:_
The author explored an unique structure for the 3D visualization. By changing the heightOffset, the small island can be flat, floating in the sky or like an tropical island floating on the sea. It also spins nonstop to keep user's attention so I think it's a successful generative art project.

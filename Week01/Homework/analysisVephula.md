## WikiGalaxy

**Creater** : Owen Cornec (France)
[http://www.polyfra.me](http://www.polyfra.me)

Engineering student in Paris, finishing up master degree in computer sciences. The project were made in free time outside curriculum.

An interactive visualization of Wikipedia articles as a galaxy of stars.
Relevant articles are grouped together into clusters of stars, creating a constellation of human knowledge.

**Technology** : HTML5, CS33, WebGL, jQuery, THREE.js

### UX flows
1. Click "Launch".

2. Hover over colored stars and click on one of them.

3. Read the article and see how it related to other articles.

### Analysis
The experiment's purpose is to emphasis how each article is related to each other in visualizing approach which is very successful. Article categories are varied e.g. society, people, history, culture, geography, science and so fourth. User can either see from bird eye view or even really fly among those stars. Therefore, it is an enjoyable way to read & learn from the wiki.

## Sliider

**Creater** : Vibeke Bertelsen (Denmark)
[http://www.udart.dk/](http://www.udart.dk/)

Visual artist based in Copenhagen who specializes in motion graphics and video projections for live music and other events, a part of the group called Obscura working full time doing large scale visuals and video installations. 

Sliider is an application for live performance. By creating html pages with graphics whether they are based on WebGl, canvas, SVG or even flash, Sliider will be capable to work. User can have custom buttons and sliders in the control window of the application.

**Technology** : Node-Webkit, Chromium embedded framework, WebGL

### UX flows
1. (Syphon version) Open the app, see 2 windows appear: display and control.

2. Click "Open" on the control screen.

3. Choose html file.

4. Tweak the controller knob and see how display changes.

### Analysis

The application generates stunning visual 3D arts by using web developer's tools such as WebGl, canvas, SVG and flash. This will be difficult for non-developer users to find these resources. However, in terms of the efficiency of the finish product, it is very successful. As it intended to work with creator's VJ performance, the display is perfect and ready to go with some electronic musics.
